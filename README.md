# Indian Flag Project

This project dynamically generates the Indian national flag using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases the power of web technologies to create engaging, animated visuals in the browser. 

## Features

- **Dynamic Generation**: The Indian flag is created programmatically using JavaScript, with elements for each stripe and the Ashoka Chakra.
- **Responsive Design**: The flag adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a consistent display across devices.
- **Animation**: A subtle animation effect is applied to the flag columns to enhance visual appeal.
- **Interactive**: The project demonstrates how code can be used to bring static designs to life interactively.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Styling for the flag's appearance and responsiveness.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for dynamically creating and animating the flag elements.

## How It Works

1. **Flag Construction**: The flag is composed of a series of `span` elements, each representing a column of color. The orange, white, and green stripes are defined using CSS.
   
2. **Ashoka Chakra**: The Ashoka Chakra is added as a background image in the center stripe using JavaScript. It is centered within the white stripe to represent the wheel of law.
   
3. **Flagpole**: A vertical div represents the flagpole on the left side of the flag.

4. **Animation**: Each column of the flag has a slight animation delay, creating a wave effect as the page loads.

## Installation
